       ;       Task 2:
       ;       Convert the integer stored in 'num' into 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point format.
       ;       Make sure both positive and negative numbers are properly converted.
       ;       ***IMPORTANT: Store your result in 'res'
       ;
       ;       Hint: a number multiplied by or divided by 2 can be achieved using shift operations.
       ;       Code correctness, efficiency, clarity and simplicity are all examined in this task.
       ;


       ; Tips: you have to understand the 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point format.
       
num    DCD     0xF0100080
