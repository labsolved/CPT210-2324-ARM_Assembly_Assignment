       ;       Task 1:
       ;
       ;       Write a program to sum up the absolute values of
       ;       negative numbers stored in "nums".
       ;       "Nums" always ends with value 0 and there will
       ;       never be any 0s in the middle.
       ;
       ;       In the example given below, the result should be:
       ;       "1 + 2 + 9 = 12"
       ;       
       ;       ***IMPORTANT: Result should be stored into "abs".
       ;
       ;       Marks will be deducted if result is not saved properly.
       ;       No need to consider overflow and underflow in this task.
       ;       Code correctness, clarity and simplicity are examined in this task.



       ; Tips: this is an easy task

nums   DCD     -1, -2, 7, 3, -9, 0
abs    FILL    4
